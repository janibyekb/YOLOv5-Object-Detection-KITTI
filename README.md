### 1. Introduction

```
Object detection is a crucial aspect in the development of autonomous vehicles, enabling
them to perceive and navigate their surroundings effectively. This project focuses on
implementing object detection system using YOLO neural network-based model with KITTI
dataset. The primary goal is to train a model capable of accurately identifying and localizing
objects in real-world driving scenarios.
```

### 2. YOLO

```
You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a family of real-time object detection algorithms that gained
popularity for their speed and accuracy. The YOLO algorithm works by dividing an image into
a grid and making predictions for bounding boxes and class probabilities within each grid
cell, enabling efficient and rapid detection of multiple objects in a single pass. And which
also claims to be one of the most promising deep learning detection systems out in the wild.
```
```
For this project, we will be using YOLOv5 , which developed by Ultralytics, builds upon the
success of its predecessors.
```

### 3. Dataset- KITTI

```
The KITTI dataset, renowned for its relevance to autonomous driving research, serves as the
primary dataset for this project. They are captured from driving sessions around the city of
Karlsruhe (Germany), in rural areas and on highways.
The dataset consists of 7481 training images with a resolution of 1240 x 375 pixels.
```
```
Classes notated in the datasets include:
```
- Car • Van • Truck • Pedestrian • Person sitting
- Cyclist • Tram • Misc. • Don’t care
